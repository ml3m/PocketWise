Explanation:

User: Represents a user of the expense management app. Each user has a username
and password. Expense: Represents an expense recorded by a user. It includes
details such as the date, category, description, amount, and a reference to the
user who recorded it. Category: Represents different expense categories. Each
category has a name. Relationships:

Each User can have multiple Expense entries, represented by the association
line between User and Expense. Each Expense entry belongs to one User,
represented by the aggregation (association with diamond) from Expense to User.
Each Expense entry is associated with one Category, represented by the
association line between Expense and Category. This UML diagram provides a
basic structure for your classes and their relationships. You can expand upon
it as needed, adding more attributes and methods to each class to fulfill the
requirements of your expense management app. Let me know if you need further
clarification or assistance!

Explanation:

User: Represents a user of the expense management app. It includes attributes
like username, password, and email. Expense: Represents an expense recorded by
a user. It includes details such as the date, description, amount, category,
and a reference to the user who recorded it. Category: Represents different
expense categories. Each category has a name. Budget: Represents the budget set
by a user for a specific month. It includes the user, month, and a map of
category budgets. ExpenseManager: Acts as a manager class responsible for
managing users, categories, and expenses. It holds vectors of users and
categories. Relationships:

User has a one-to-many relationship with Expense (one user can have multiple
expenses). Expense has an association with Category (each expense belongs to a
category). Expense has an association with User (each expense is associated
with a user). Budget has an association with User (each budget is associated
with a user). Budget has an association with Category (each budget includes
category budgets). ExpenseManager holds a collection of User and Category
objects. This UML diagram reflects a more object-oriented approach, with
classes representing real-world entities and their relationships. It provides a
foundation for implementing your expense management app in a modular and
extensible manner. Let me know if you need further explanation or assistance!
