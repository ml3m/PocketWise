Creating an expense management app in C++ is a great project idea! Since you're
considering a terminal-based application, it will provide a solid foundation
for understanding the core concepts of programming and data management. Here
    are the requirements and functionalities your expense management app should
    have: Requirements: User Authentication: Allow users to register with a
    username and password. Enable login functionality to access the app.
    Expense Tracking: Users should be able to add new expenses. Expenses should
    include details such as date, category, description, and amount. Allow
    users to view, edit, and delete existing expenses. Expense Categories:
    Predefine categories such as groceries, transportation, rent, utilities,
    entertainment, etc. Users should have the option to add custom categories.
    Budget Management: Enable users to set monthly budgets for different
    expense categories. Display budget vs. actual expenses for each category.
    Data Persistence: Implement data storage to save user information,
    expenses, and settings. Use file handling or a lightweight database (like
    SQLite) for data storage. Reports and Analysis: Provide summary reports
    showing total expenses, spending trends over time, and breakdown by
    category. Include options for data visualization, such as a pie chart,
    using libraries like matplotplusplus. Search and Filtering: Allow users to
    search for specific expenses based on date, category, or amount range.
    Implement filtering options to view expenses for a specific time period or
    category. Settings and Customization: Allow users to customize settings
    such as currency symbol, date format, and language preferences. User
    Interface: Since it will be a terminal-based application, simplicity and
    ease of use are key. Here's how the user interface could look:

markdown Copy code Welcome to Your Expense Management App!

1. Login
2. Register
3. Exit

Enter your choice: _

After login:

1. Add Expense
2. View Expenses
3. Edit Expense
4. Delete Expense
5. View Reports
6. Set Budget
7. Settings
8. Logout

Enter your choice: _ GUI Consideration: If you decide to switch to a GUI-based
application, it can enhance user experience and provide more interactive
features. You can use frameworks like Qt or wxWidgets for C++ GUI development.
However, starting with a terminal-based app is a good way to grasp the
fundamentals before diving into GUI development.

For tutorials, there are plenty of online resources available. You can start
with basic C++ tutorials for file handling and data structures. Then, explore
tutorials on building terminal-based applications and integrating libraries
like matplotplusplus for data visualization. Once you're comfortable, you can
explore GUI development tutorials for C++.

Remember to break down your project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a
time. Good luck with your expense management app development! If you need
further assistance or clarification on any topic, feel free to ask.
